# Masters_Project
My Research and Final Project for Master's

Outline:
Purpose:
With the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the International Monetary Fund, I can examine the performance percentages of different area data, and examine how well the economy is doing for that area. With this data I plan to highlight the changes of the economy and how global phenomena, such as pandemics, can impact the economy of the entire world. With this data I can show visualizations and predictions of how a future pandemic can impact the future economy; this will help nations or cooperates understand and further prepare themselves in case another phenomenon were to happen.  


Preplan (so far 12/13/2023)

Part 1:
Import the data into a notebook for cleaning
Organize each dataset into a dataframe using pandas. 
Clean the dataframe by removing duplicate rows and then I will group them by country code.
Export new dataframes

Part 2:
 Import new data into a python flask
Several different hyperlinks for each dataset 
Using javascript and plotty function to create several different graphs such as line graphs, heat maps, and bar plots to show the trends in the data. 
I will then use the sklearn.feature_selection function to train the datasets and create predict variables. 
With those variables I will then make new plots and give visuals of those datasets.
